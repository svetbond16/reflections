How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It made it much more easiear.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    There will be less fears of breaking something forever.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you can combine changes on a logical parts.
    Contras:you can forget to do this for a long time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    A change in a web-project often concerns a couple of files simultaneously,
    while GoogleDocs is often about making changes just in a current document. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    it makes it easy to view and compare the history of files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You understand, that you can easy find a mistake or go back and it will
    work like nothing have happend.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try for compliting next quizes.
