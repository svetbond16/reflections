When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    It makes easy to make some changes when you are outside your working place, or
when you are not the only one who works on this project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    When you pull changes manually you have more control to decide if you need 
    that changes on your locall repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?
    Forks are copies of GitHub repository on GitHub only.
    Clones are copies of a repository both on GitHub or on your local computer.
    Branches are different versions of your code on your local computer.
