When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    It makes easy to make some changes when you are outside your working place, or
when you are not the only one who works on this project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    When you pull changes manually you have more control to decide if you need 
    that changes on your locall repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?
    Forks are copies of GitHub repository on GitHub only.
    Clones are copies of a repository both on GitHub or on your local computer.
    Branches are different versions of your code on your local computer.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored 
locally?
    When you have a copy of the last known state it is easier to continue to work 
    even if you are offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and 
what would be harder?
    Without Git I would probably collaborate using email, sending code, asking 
    about checking it and commenting it. I am sure it is much easier to 
    collaborate with Git and espesially with GitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master? What benefits does each approach have?
    I would like to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
    master when I neeed to collaborate with people, to find 
    and fix the mistakes, to get a feedback on my changes, without changing my 
    master. And only after doing all that I change master in a considered manner. 
    Of course it takes more time than making changes directly in master, but it
    worth it.
